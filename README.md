# Uber App Backend

Welcome to the Uber App Backend repository. This project is the starting point for developing a comprehensive ride-sharing application, similar to Uber, focusing initially on the backend using Spring Boot.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the backend implementation for an Uber-like ride-sharing application. The backend is built using Spring Boot, which provides a robust, scalable, and efficient foundation for handling the various functionalities required by a ride-sharing platform.

## Features

### User Management
- **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure registration and login for both passengers and drivers.
- **Profile Management:** Allow users to update and manage their profiles.

### Ride Management
- **Ride Request:** Passengers can request rides by specifying pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Ride Matching:** Match passengers with available drivers based on proximity and availability.
- **Ride Tracking:** Real-time tracking of rides for both passengers and drivers.
- **Ride Completion:** Manage ride completion and payment processing.

### Driver Management
- **Driver Onboarding:** Secure registration and verification for new drivers.
- **Driver Availability:** Manage driver availability status.
- **Driver Rating:** Allow passengers to rate drivers after ride completion.

### Payment Processing
- **Fare Calculation:** Calculate ride fares based on distance, time, and surge pricing.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Secure integration with payment gateways for processing payments.

### Notification System
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Send real-time notifications for ride requests, status updates, etc.
- **Email and SMS Alerts:** Notify users through email and SMS for critical updates.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot:** Main framework for building the backend application.
- **Spring Security:** For implementing authentication and authorization.
- **Hibernate/JPA:** For database interaction.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL:** As the relational database system.
- **Redis:** For caching and session management.
- **RabbitMQ/Kafka:** For message queuing and asynchronous task handling.
- **RESTful APIs:** For communication between the client and server.
- **Docker:** For containerization of the application.
- **Swagger:** For API documentation.
